## Question 12

  In a sample of 425 measurements, it is observed that the average weight of the products that were measured is 226g, with a standard deviation of 10g. 
  Establish the confidence interval for this average, knowing that the standard deviation observed is exactly its historical value. Consider a level of confidence of 95%
## Answer

The CI formula when the experimental design/sample sizes are small or when the standard deviation of the population is unknown:

$$\mathrm{CI} = \bar{X} \pm (t_{n – 1} \times\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}})$$
The tn−1 is taken from the t distribution based the degree of freedom and on the probability α that CI does not include the true population mean.

When the experimental design/sample sizes are large or when the standard deviation of the population is known then CI formula is:

$$\mathrm{CI} = \bar{X} \pm (z_{\frac{1 – α}{2}} \times\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}})$$


```{r}

n <- 425
wg_obs <- 226
sd_obs <- 10

crit_val <- qnorm(1-0.05/2)
crit_val

delta <- crit_val * sd_obs / sqrt(n)

CIinf <- wg_obs - delta
Csup <- wg_obs + delta
CIinf
Csup
```
