This are basic instructions that comes with tha layout
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


You can format texts:
- *italic*: * at the beginning and end of sentence
- **bold**: addind ** at the beginning and end of sentence
- To create bullet points just do: * at the beginning of the sentence
* Title 1
* Title 2
  * Subtitle 2
  To do that give a tab
  
To write something at the bottom use ~ at the beginnig and end of element
H~2~O

To write something at the top use ^ at the beginnig and end of element
a^2^+b^2^ = c^2^

You can use LaTex format to write equations
For example:
$a=b^2$
to write in the same line
$$ a = \sqrt{b}+c^2$$
$$ a = ({b} \times {c})+ (\dfrac {d}{e})$$
$$ \alpha_1 = \beta_1 + \beta_2^3 $$

Introducing chunks: thats where we are going to code
```{r}
array <- c(1:5)
array
```
